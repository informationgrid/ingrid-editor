# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server

## Development

Run IgeServer.java as Java Application.

With the following command a jar is generated, which contains the whole server: 
TBD: create an installer instead

> mvn clean package

If you want to use the OrientDB-Studio, then copy the zip-File "orientdb-studio-\<version\>.zip" into the plugins-directory. Afterwards it is available under the port 2480.

For the apache configuration use the following settings:

```
location /ige-server/ {
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' *;
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, PUT,DELETE, OPTIONS';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Accept,Authorization,Cache-Control,Content-Type,DNT,If-Modified-Since,Keep-Alive,Origin,User-Agent,X-Mx-ReqToken,X-Requested-With';
    proxy_pass http://192.168.0.238:8111/;
}

location /orientdb-studio/ {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_pass http://192.168.0.238:2480/;
}
```

To get the swagger-api json documentation go to http://localhost:8081/v1/api-docs. The UI version can be accessed with http://localhost:8081/v1, where you also can test the API.

### OrientDB Studio

Copy the zip file from the distribution (e.g. https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/orientdb3/releases/3.0.2/orientdb-3.0.2.tar.gz) and put it into the plugins directory.
After a restart of the server the Studio should be available under http://localhost:2480.

If this does not work, check the logs for a correct link. Otherwise unpack the zip-file into "src/site" (everything under www).
It's possible that the database cannot be found because there're wrong api calls. Open main.js file and search for "/api/" and replace it with "/".

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application  

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to
