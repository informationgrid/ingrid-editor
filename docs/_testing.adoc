== Testing

=== Frontend

The tests can be run inside the `frontend`-directory with:

[source,shellscript]
----
yarn test
# or
ng test
----

This will start a `karma`-server where the tests are executed inside a browser. The tests are recognized by the file-ending `*.spec.ts`.

The execution can be configured in the file `karma.conf.js`. 

=== Backend

The tests are found in the directory `server/src/test`. You can run the tests with your IntelliJ-IDE by right-clicking onto the folder and execute the `Run 'Tests in ...'`-command. 

You can also run them from the command line by issuing the following command:

[source,shellscript]
----
./gradlew server:test
----

For some integration-tests you need a running PostgreSQL database with a separate database (default is `test`). This can be configured in the file `application-test.properties`.
