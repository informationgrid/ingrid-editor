= Permissions / Authorisation

Since Keycloak is only used for authentication the app has to take care of the authorisation. Authorisation is needed to
allow a user access to a resource. A resource can be dataset (document or address), a whole page (e.g. import) or even a
single action on a page (may view all users but not manipulate them).

== Technical implementation

Authorisation is implemented by Spring Security and the domain object security (ACLs). With Spring Security resources
can be restricted to specific user roles. Functions can be annotated to prevent illegal access:

| Annotation     | Erkl√§rung                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @PreAuthorize  | check before a function is executed                                 |
| @PostAuthorize | check after a function is executed                                  |
| @PreFilter     | check multiple resources for permission before function is executed |
| @PostFilter    | check multiple resources for permission after function is executed  |

These annotations can be used with expressions, to check for a role or a more fine-grained permission. This looks like:

```kotlin
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
fun create(contact: Contact)

@PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#contact, 'admin')")
fun deletePermission(contact: Contact, recipient: Sid, permission: Permission)
```

Normally a resource is checked directly before it's accessed, which is done at a `Repository`.

== Spring Data Repositories

The abstraction of the database is done by repositories. A repository is an interface which extends the
interface `JpaRepository`. Out of the box it already delivers CRUD-operations onto the database. For special database
queries we only need to add another function to the interface where the name follows the convention. Then the SQL will
be automatically generated from the function name.

It's also possible to define your own query as JPA-Query or native query.

To secure access to a database resource, we only have to add an annotation to the interface function.

Database access should be protected in those repositories to prevent security holes.

== Permission check

Whenever a permission is checked with the expression `hasPermission(...)`, the corresponding configured class
`IgeAclPermissionEvaluator` is responsible.

The implementation does the following things:

- allow access if principal has role `ige-super-admin` or `cat-admin`
- or check if a user has rights to access the requested resource

The latter one is more complex and will be explained below in more detail. In short the users' groups are checked if
they contain the permission (read/write) for the requested resource.

== Spring ACL

In order to manage access to resources (RBAC), Spring offers an Access Control List (ACL) library to simplify the
process. As a prerequisite four tables are needed in the database:

| Table               | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| acl_sid             | Each group represents a SID                                                                                                                              |
| acl_class           | Each protected resource type is defined as its class, e.g. `DocumentWrapper`                                                                             |
| acl_object_identity | Every resource must be listed, before it can be protected. Moreover it's possible to create the entries hierarchically, in order to inherit permissions. |
| acl_entry           | Here the actual permission (read/write/subtree) is listed. Each permission is connected to a SID (group) and an object identity (UUID)                   |

When a permission for a resource is checked, it uses the following procedure:

- get ACL of a object identity (UUID)
- check if requested permission is given to this UUID
- if not, get the parent ACL and check permission there (inheritance is used by default)
- only if the resource or one of its parents has the correct permission, access will be allowed
- otherwise an `Access denied` Exception will be thrown.

== Principal

A principal contains the currently logged in user with additional information about the roles and groups it belongs to.
When the application is accessed by the browser it first is checked for authentication through Keycloak and after a
successful login a special Keycloak Principal is available in the API-Controller.

When running scheduling tasks, which need to access the database, we have to use a principal with the correct
permissions. Otherwise we would be denied access, since no principal is present during a scheduled task, since no
external user action initiated the request.

To work around this problem, a principal needs to be created manually for the task, with the necessary access rights.
This can be done the following way:

```kotlin
val auth: Authentication =
    UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken("Scheduler", "Task", listOf(SimpleGrantedAuthority("cat-admin")))
SecurityContextHolder.getContext().authentication = auth
```

Here's a principal created with the role `cat-admin`, which will be used during the permission checks.

== Roles

The IGE-NG supports the following roles:

- ige-super-admin - full access to every IGE-NG instance
- cat-admin - full access to a defined IGE-NG instance
- md-admin - limited access to a defined IGE-NG instance with user management
- author - limited access to a defined IGE-NG instance to limited access to resources

At the time of this writing these roles are mapped to a list of permissions, which can be used to allow access to functions. These functions can be either in the frontend or the backend. Instead of using the role of a user, you should use the permission to check for access. This is more fine granular and can be more easily adapted during future changes.

The mapping of the permissions to a role can be found in the class `CatalogService.getPermissions()`
