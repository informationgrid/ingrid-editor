== Interfaces
This section describes the supported API endpoints and their authentications.

=== Swagger-UI
Swagger-UI can help to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources.

* http://localhost:8550/swagger-ui/index.html
* https://ige-ng.informationgrid.eu/swagger-ui/index.html

To test an API endpoint via the Swagger UI, remember to select the responsible server (Servers drop-down) and enter a valid Bearer Token (Authorise button).

=== Authentication
All APIs are secured using OAuth 2.0 via Keycloak. In order to interact with endpoints, a bearer token must first be obtained.

NOTE: Access tokens are valid for 1 minute. After its expiration the token must be refreshed with a refresh token.

==== Obtain Token via Browser
An access token can be obtained via browser developer tool. This approach is recommended for simple test only.

. Log in to InGrid-Editor
. Open developer tools and select 'Network'
. Refresh page
. Select the object with the name 'currentUser' and open the request headers
. Copy the long string of 'Authorization' (NOTE: without 'Bearer' )


==== Obtain Token via Postman
For more advanced testing, Postman can help to maintain a fresh access token. Set up an OAuth 2.0 authentication with the following variables.
